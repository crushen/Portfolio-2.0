The brief for this website was to design and create an online space that has an organic flow, and stays true to the brands minimal aesthetic.<br><br>I decided to use Vue.js for this project because of it's fast rendering and loading time. This paired with a GraphQL API makes a seamless transition between project pages. On the backend I integrated GraphCMS, which makes it really simple for the brand to manage and update their content.",
